# SMPv3

We are using Essential instead of a server to play together

The latest version is always the higher number.
For example if there are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 then 5 is the latest version.

Other versions will simply be kept incase of mod erros, so its easy to revert

Install this using CurseForges import function.
