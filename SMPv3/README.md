# SMPv3

We are using Essential instead of a server to play together

The latest version is always the higher number.
For example if there are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 then 5 is the latest version.

Other versions will simply be kept incase of mod errors, so its easy to revert

If they are in a folder, open the folder then download all the files inside
from there with all these files in the same path extract them,
then open to the folder that says "Import This Zip"
inside this folder will be another zip, this is the zip you will select with curseforge.

Install this using CurseForges import function.
